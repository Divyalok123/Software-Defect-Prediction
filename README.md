# Software_Defect_Prediction

**Software Defect Prediction** is one of the most assisting activities of the testing phase of **Software Development Life Cycle**. It helps to identify the defect-prone modules and provides development groups with observable results.

In this project, we used **NASA** datasets from the [PROMISE Software Engineering Repository](http://promise.site.uottawa.ca/SERepository/datasets-page.html) and built prediction models using **Convolutional Neural Network**, **Random Forest Classifier**, **Support Vector Machine** and tested them on various metrics.

For performance evaluation, we used four widely used metrics: Precision, Recall, Accuracy, and AUC curve.
