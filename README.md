# Software_Defect_Prediction

**Software Defect Predicition** is one of the most assisting activities of the testing phase of **software Development Life Cycle**. It helps identifying the defect prone modules and provide development groups with observable results.

In this project, we used the datasets from the [NASA PROMISE Software Engineering Repository](http://promise.site.uottawa.ca/SERepository/datasets-page.html) to create a CNN model. For performance evaluation we used four widely used metrics: Precision, Recall, Accuracy and AUC curve.

This project is done under the guidance of **Prof. Shweta Meena (Delhi Technological University)**. We are thankful to her for her continuos support and expert guidance.
